            My name is Sam Donaghy-Bell.  
            <br />
            I live just outside Belfast and I currently work as a Software Engineer for a

              Before the project came to an end I was part of the Vertica team
              tasked with localising the customer facing Management Console for
              white label use in any language required.
              <br />
              <br />
              This required use of the i18Next translation tool and on
              completion was worth several million dollars in sales for the
              company.
              <br />
              <br />
              I&apos;m currently part of a team developing a platform to be used by police detectives to organise case data and display it across their internal teams.

              Get Crew is a database platform for UK and Irish Film, Television
              and Broadcast crew to host their professional profiles. ¬†I built
              it as a side project to fill a void in the industry.
              <br />
              <br />
              It allows anyone to search for crew via department, filter by role
              and contact each person. It allows registered users to list their
              credits, website, skills, working locations, update their
              availability and more.
              <br />
              <br />
              It has a Stripe payment system intergrated for registered users to
              pay and have their profile go live.
              <br />
              The platform is self-sufficient requiring minimal input to keep it
              up and running.

              During my 12 years as a Camera Engineer in the Film and Television
              industry I also built Ireland&apos;s biggest and most reputable
              drone filming company.
              <br />
              <br />
              The company has been operating since 2013 and currently employs 4
              full time and 3 part time staff. ¬†CineCopters provides drones and
              cameras to the biggest productions shooting in Ireland with
              clients including Disney, Netflix, BBC&apos;s Top Gear, RedBull,
              Universal Pictures, Land Rover, Ford and many more.
              <br />
              <br />I built the website for CineCopters which contains a stock
              footage ordering platform and also allows existing clients to
              manage bookings for upcoming shoots.

              I&apos;m an extremely driven person and a fast learner with a
              &quot;challenge accepted&quot; approach to anything I don&apos;t

              I&apos;m a firm believer in learn by doing and muscle
